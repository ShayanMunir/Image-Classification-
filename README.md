# Image-Classification-
This project implements an image classification model using deep learning techniques to categorize images of various fruits and vegetables, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras for accurate identification of the provided images. The dataset consists of training data for model learning, validation data for performance checking, and testing data for final evaluation, with all images preprocessed to a uniform size of 180x180 pixels. The model features a CNN architecture for effective image feature extraction, employs data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping for improved robustness, and utilizes TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory API for efficient data loading. Key dependencies include Python 3.x, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and loss, with visualizations of training and validation results showcasing the model’s progress. The CNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying fruit and vegetable images, highlighting its potential for food-related image recognition tasks.
